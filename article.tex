\section{Introduction\label{sec:Introduction}}
Group name: Silicon\\
Predictive modeling in the automotive industry has become increasingly relevant and valuable in recent years, offering insights into vehicle performance, efficiency, and market trends. In this study, we address two fundamental questions \ref{sec:Research Question}
 
These questions drive our investigation into the predictive capabilities of machine learning models when applied to a dataset comprising detailed information about automotive performance and specifications. By exploring these questions, we aim to assess the feasibility and accuracy of leveraging predictive analytics techniques, particularly linear regression for mpg prediction and logistic regression for make prediction. Our findings have the potential to contribute valuable insights to the automotive industry, informing decisions related to vehicle design, marketing strategies, and consumer preferences.


% The introduction must put your paper into a context.
% The reader should be able to understand your paper based on the background information provided in the introduction.

\section{Research Question\label{sec:Research Question}}
Q1: Is it possible to predict the outcome of a car's miles per gallon (mpg) based on various factors such as the number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, origin, make and model?\\
Q2: Is it possible to predict a car's make based on the same factors?

% The research question must be phrased as a question, ending with "?".
% It is often a good idea to structure your research question into one overall question with a number of sub-questions, and you can number them i.e. Q1, Q2 etc. to make it easy to refer to them.
% Alternatively, you can phrase a hypothesis instead of a research question.

\section{Methods\label{sec:Methods}}

A correlation matrix was created after cleaning up the dataset. This matrix showed a strong negative linear relationship between mgp, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, and weight. This enabled the study to move forward with the hypothesis that we could determine mgp based on our dataset.

In this study, linear regression and logistic regression were applied to predict the outcome of a car's miles per gallon and make, respectively. Linear regression utilized factors such as the number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, origin, and car name to predict miles per gallon. Logistic regression used the same factors to predict the car's make.

The dataset, provided by Henrik Str√∏m, an AI teacher at KEA, included details on car performance and make. Initial examination revealed faulty and deficient data. Using well know data cleaning techniques such as Preprocessing \textcite{hellerstein2013quantitative}

Following the data completion, feature engineering was conducted. This process transformed categorical variables, such as make and model, into numerical values through the use of one-hot encoding, enabling their inclusion in the regression analysis.

Different machine learning models were considered, and their performances were gauged using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and root mean squared error.

% The methods section is for documenting the methods you apply to conduct your research.
% It is about the methods and how they will be applied, but not about their actual application.
% Ideally, you should write your method section before you start the actual research.
% The methods section must be well referenced.

\section{Analysis\label{sec:Analysis}}

% In the analysis section you apply the methods you described in the method section.
% It is specific to your particular paper and your particular research question.
% Make sure to make cross references back to your method section.

\section{Findings\label{sec:Findings}}

% Here you present your findings, that is what came out of your analysis.
% Make sure to cross reference back to your analysis section.

\section{Conclusion\label{sec:Conclusion}}

% In the conclusion you answer your research question based on your findings.
% Make sure to make cross references to your research question, analysis, and findings sections.
